Bayes Theorem (the Bayes formula) / Solution of the problem / Elementary probability theory 

Terms of the Task:
The electric motor (e/m) is connected to the device in the assembly shop.
In warehouse has three variants of e/m from three different manufacturing plants,
respectively, in the number of N1, N2 and N3 pieces that can work up to the end of
the warranty period with probabilities p1, p2 and p3, respectively.
The worker takes accidentally one e/m and mounts it to the device.
Learning the likelihood that the mounted and working failsafe until the end of
the warranty period e/m is delivered from first, second and the third manufacturers.
Determine the parameters by the following formulas:
      k = | 14 - V |, where V is the variant number; 
      p1 = 0.99 - k / 100; 
      p2 = 0.9 - k / 100; 
      p3 = 0.85 - k / 100; 
      N1 = 5 + k; 
      N2 = 20 - k; 
      N3 = 25 - k.
